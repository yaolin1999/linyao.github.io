            <p>“If God wants you to be an eagle, he will give you a wilderness first.” As the first girl in my big family who is pursuing graduate study, I have faced many “wildernesses” during my education, which has both limited me and broadened my horizons at the same time. Working all the way from the bottom, sometimes I wonder whether I have traveled too far away from where I come from — a family of farmers, working the land day and night. However, I have gradually realized that this seemingly distant decision to study is actually inseparable from the influence of my family and my growth process.</p>
<p>Learning in a countryside primary school where there were only three teachers in my grade, my father showed me the secret of hard work and perseverance. After the tiring farm work in the daytime, he would read and write poems at night and has done so for the past twenty years. Sometimes he would write poems until twelve o ‘clock at night and get up early the next day. Life’s hardships never defeated him. And he made one of his dreams into reality – he published his own poems. Whenever I encounter difficulties in my studies, the figure of my father always appears. This kind of atmosphere cultivated my firm determination and improved my self-control. He inspired me that any wilderness was a good chance to learn and that it would provide me with a unique perspective for life.</p>
<p>My father was right. His advanced education concept, which attached great importance to the combination of study and life, has turned all the hardships I have undergone into nutrients and touchstones. Since junior high, I used to go to the market with my father every summer and winter vacation to sell our family’s agricultural products. There I heard farmers complaining about the warm winter because the unusually high temperatures made them unable to sell their greenhouse vegetables for a good price. One summer, due to rarely-seen torrential rains, the ponds in many farms overflowed and fish escaped into canals or sewers, causing great losses. I also heard my parents complaining that the rainy weather made the livestock more susceptible to sicknesses. In addition, my grandparents planted according to some old proverbs related to weather and climate. Some of these were reasonable while others were just confusing. I realized that there was still so much misunderstanding about nature and we remained vulnerable to severe weather phenomena and abnormal climate fluctuations. I did not appreciate it at the time, but in fact, my country life buried seeds of curiosity in my young heart and helped me clearly find my goal in life and later pursue my dreams very firmly.</p>
<p>After I entered college, I became more interested in Atmospheric Sciences. When I was an exchange student in the summer session at UC Berkeley, I shared a piece of news about climate change in front of the whole class. We had a hot debate. Many people asked me related questions including the reliability of global warming and the responsibilities that different countries should take. I came to realize that people around the world were greatly concerned about climate issues and there were controversial misunderstandings and unsolved problems to explore. This made me more determined to this major.</p>
<p>Due to my background and experiences, I always try my best to help students from low-paid families and left-behind children from poorly-educated families. The higher I go in my education, the fewer students from these kinds of families I see. I understand that children in such families have more wilderness than others to overcome – aside from the lack of resources, I mean also psychologically. Their parents may send them to a school that does not live up to their abilities and they may be forced unconsciously to grab a job as quickly as they can. What I want to do is to bury seeds of dreams in their hearts and encourage them. I want to tell them that no matter where you are, having an undefeated dream will make a great difference and help you to go all the way through your dilemmas. That is why I spend my time teaching a junior high school student, who lives in the mountainous areas in Yunnan Province. I try to open her mind to how fantastic the world is and encourage her and others to work hard and to travel out of those mountains and chase their dreams. I also acted as the student tutor for a class where most students came from poor families. I love sharing understandings and opinions with them.</p>
<p>Throughout my education experience, I am always hoping to get a higher level of education and access to a broader platform of people. When I was a primary school student, only three students in the whole school were admitted to the best junior high school in the local area. I was one of them. After graduation from junior high school, five people were admitted to the best senior high school in the local area, and I was one of them too. After graduating from high school, I came to one of the best universities in China with my hard work and passion for knowledge. In this process, I kept breaking through my limits and myself. I believe that this character trait of pursuing the best outcomes will enable me to keep moving forward in my own field.</p>
<p>Before I went to college, the motivation for my study was to escape from the hard farm work, where one needs to get out early and go home late every day, and from the worry that rainfall or a snowstorm would ruin all one’s efforts in a season. However, after reflecting on all my struggles and trials, I hope to do something for farmers like my family, by studying weather phenomena and climate change. Although I do not have the ability to control the weather processes, I can deepen our understanding of their dynamics, which, I believe, is the foundation of atmospheric sciences. I hope to improve the forecasting ability of models through scientific research and help the government and society be better prepared for climate change. In addition, I love teaching and I hope to help children from low-income families to a better education. If they can rise above class barriers, I believe they have the same possibility to break through the limits of human understanding and help solve our mysterious climate problems.</p>

It is mainly based on the budget equation for the spacial variance of the column-integrated frozen moist static energy (FMSE). It presents the evolution of various physical varibles comprehensively with diagrams both in space and time. It also explains the reasons of such evolution, which includes the explanations for longwave radiative heating by using a simple two-layer model and those for surface fluxes which are divided into three components (a wind-driven section, a surface disequilibrium section and an eddy section).</p>

<li><p>This paper does not consider the external forces like large-scale sea surface gradient and wind shears. I am wondering what the roles of wind shears play in the development of self-aggregation. What kinds of wind shears will influence self-aggregaion? Maybe I can find more in <em>Robe and Emanuel [2001]</em>.</p>

#### Inspiration for my research

The most important reference value of this paper for my research lays in its analysis on longwave radiation and surface fluxes (Section 7.2 and 7.3). I am thinking about applying
